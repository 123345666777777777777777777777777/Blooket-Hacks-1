Accessing the Services and Account Security
We may withdraw or amend the Services, and any related service or content, or restrict access (including by means of cancellation, termination, or modification, or suspension of a user account) to all or certain users (including you) without notice and without liability to you in our reasonable discretion. Additionally, due to your geographic location, the Services or some of their features, services, or content may be unavailable to you. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, we may terminate or suspend access to the Services based on your breach of these Terms.
To access certain Services, you may be asked to create an account or provide registration details or other information, and in order to use such resources, all the information you provide must be correct, current, and complete.

For clarity, the foregoing permissions are limited to the Services, and no rights are granted with respect to any servers, computers, or databases associated with the Services.
The above license (i) will terminate when you delete any User Submissions with intellectual property rights (‚ÄúIP content‚Äù), like photos, you or your institution deletes an Education Record, you delete any personal information, or you delete your account, unless your content has been shared with others and they have not deleted it, you have made Question Sets public or your content is part of an Education Record still under the control of your institution (e.g., co-teaching). If you would like to delete your account, please see the Settings on your BLOOKET Dashboard which allows you to delete your account in the Edit Info section.
Blooket will not heed any deletion requests of "teacher accounts" or "teacher content" made by the educational institution, company or organization, as this should be handled by the educational institution, company or organization itself in accordance with its internal regulations or teacher employment agreements.
Additionally, when you delete IP content, Education Records, or personal information, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle or trash bin on a computer. However, you understand that any removed User Submission may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time. Note that the information contained in Blooket's security backups or copies will not be available or accessible to others.
Ownership of BLOOKET Teacher Accounts
Your account belongs to you, regardless of the email address you used when signing up for the Services. However, please keep in mind that if your educational institution, organization or company disables your email address and you‚Äôre not able to log in, we won't be able to recover your account.
Additionally, if you utilize the Service through a Plus license acquired by another party for you to use (e.g., bought by your school for teaching purposes), the party paying for such feature has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid feature; however, they do not have rights to your personal account.
Additional Terms by User Types
Students
If you are a student accessing the Service at the invitation of a teacher or other school official, the following terms apply to you:
Only students who have been invited by their teacher, school, or district may use the Service unless they are of an age in their country which allows the student to create an account. The age is detailed in our Privacy Policy for many of the countries whose citizens utilize the website. You may not access or use the Service unless you are invited by a teacher, school, or district who is authorized to give you access to the Service.
We request minimal personal information to be provided from students to enable use of the Service: first name, last name, username, email and password. If you are a student, please do not provide any personal information about yourself to us, other than what we request from you when you sign up for the Service.
Without prejudice to the aforementioned, when using the Game Code created by Blooket and initiated by an Account Holder, students can access and use the BLOOKET service without the need to create an account. In this modality, students may have to provide a username and only responses will be collected and processed by the service.
In the United States, The Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Act (‚ÄúCOPPA‚Äù) prohibits online service providers from knowingly collecting personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age without verifiable parental consent or notice as applicable (‚ÄúConsent‚Äù). BLOOKET only collects, uses, shares, and retains personal student information for purposes for which we were authorized by the educational institution/agency and teacher.
Teachers
If you are a teacher, aide, trainer or other similar personnel accessing the Service on behalf of an educational institution, company or organization (the "Institution"), the following terms apply to you:
You understand and acknowledge that COPPA prohibits online service providers from knowingly collecting personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age without Consent, and you understand that we only collect, use, share and retain student personal information for purposes for which we were authorized by the educational institution/agency or teacher.
You acknowledge and agree that you have School Consent to allow children under 13 to use the Service and that you and/or the Institution will be solely responsible (and hereby agree that BLOOKET is not responsible) for compliance with COPPA or any other applicable laws. This includes limiting access to the Service to those student users from whom School Personnel has received valid Consent forms and complying with all parental requests regarding the collection, use and disclosure of such child‚Äôs information. School Personnel or the educational institution are responsible for providing parental consent forms to the parents of potential student users, for confirming receipt of valid consent forms for each child before granting the student access to the Service, and for retaining such consent forms on file. If a user‚Äôs parent does not consent or rescind such School Consent, School Personnel or the educational institution shall immediately notify BLOOKET to discontinue that student‚Äôs access to the Service and ensure that such student‚Äôs information is no longer accessible through the Services.
You agree that you are acting on behalf of (or have permission from) your Institution to enter into this Agreement and to use the Service as part of your curriculum.
You agree that you are responsible for maintaining and monitoring the accuracy of the list of students for each of your classes. By way of example, you will only retain students in your classroom as long as it is reasonably needed for their educational development, which shall not exceed more than one school year.
You acknowledge and agree that, in order to guarantee the privacy and security of your students' data and provide them with the best possible experience through the BLOOKET website, only personnel who are current employees of the institution may use the service on the institution‚Äôs behalf. Upon termination of a teacher, aide, trainer, or other staff member's employment with the institution, such individual must return and cease using all login details and student access he or she has in his or her possession. Blooket shall not be responsible for the misuse of the service by institution personnel and shall not be held accountable for teachers, aides, trainers, or other staff members of the institution not returning student education records, and/or not returning and ceasing to use all login details and student access they have in their possession, upon termination of their employment agreement with the institution.
Co-Teaching
Any disputes arising between the teachers participating in the co-teaching class shall be resolved either among themselves, or with the intervention of the educational institution, company or organization. Blooket will not intervene in such conflicts and shall not be held liable for any misconduct of the teachers participating in the co-teaching class.
When setting up a co-teaching class within the service, you and the other participating co-teacher(s) agree to be equally and exclusively responsible and accountable for the class and its management.
FERPA and Student Data
Certain information that may be provided to BLOOKET by School Personnel that is directly related to a student and maintained by an educational institution, may be considered an education record (‚ÄúEducation Record‚Äù) under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (‚ÄúFERPA‚Äù). Additionally, certain information, provided to BLOOKET by School Personnel about a student, such as student name and grade level, may be considered directory information under FERPA (‚ÄúDirectory Information‚Äù) and thus not an Education Record. A school may not generally disclose personally identifiable information from an eligible student‚Äôs education records to a third party without written consent of the parent and/or eligible student or without meeting one of the exemptions set forth in FERPA (‚ÄúFERPA Exemption(s)‚Äù), including the exemption for Directory Information (‚ÄúDirectory Information Exemption‚Äù) or disclosure to school officials with a legitimate educational interest (‚ÄúSchool Official Exemption‚Äù).
As School Personnel or the Institution providing Directory Information or any Education Record to BLOOKET, you acknowledge, affirm and pledge to BLOOKET, as applicable, that your Institution has:
Complied with the Directory Information Exemption, including, without limitation, informing parents and eligible students what information the Institution deems to be directory information and allow parents and eligible students a reasonable amount of time to request that schools do not disclose directory information about them; and/or,
Complied with the School Official Exemption, including, without limitation, informing parents in their annual notification of FERPA rights that the Institution defines ‚Äúschool official‚Äù to include service providers and defines ‚Äúlegitimate educational interest‚Äù to include services such as the type provided by BLOOKET; or,
Obtained all necessary parental or eligible student written consent to share the Directory Information and Education Records with the BLOOKET, in each case, solely to enable the BLOOKET‚Äôs operation of the Service.
BLOOKET will never share Education Records with third parties except (i) as directed by an BLOOKET user (i.e., teacher sharing with another teacher or parent); or (ii) to our service providers that are necessary for us to provide the Service, as stated in our Privacy Policy. Education Records are never used or disclosed for third-party advertising or any kind of first- or third-party behaviorally-targeted advertising to students or parents. Additionally, information collected directly from a student using BLOOKET is never used or disclosed for third-party advertising, or any kind of first- or third-party behaviorally-targeted advertising, and personal information collected from a student is never sold or rented to anyone. This section shall not be construed (i) to prohibit BLOOKET from marketing or advertising directly to parents so long as the marketing or advertising did not result from the use of Education Records to provide behaviorally-targeted advertising or (ii) to limit the ability of BLOOKET to use student information or Education Records for adaptive learning or customized student learning purposes.
BLOOKET may use Education Records that have been de-identified for product development, research or other purposes (‚ÄúDe-Identified Data‚Äù). De-Identified Data will have all direct and indirect personal identifiers removed. BLOOKET agrees not to attempt to re-identify the De-Identified Data and not to transfer the De-Identified Data to a third party unless that party agrees not to attempt re-identification.
GDPR and Minors
The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) determines that the processing of personal data of a child residing in the European Union shall be lawful where the child is at least sixteen (16) years old, unless Member States have provided, by law, a lower age that is not below thirteen (13) years.
As a teacher, you acknowledge, affirm and pledge to BLOOKET that you or your Institution has obtained all necessary parental or eligible student written consent to share the personal data of your students with BLOOKET, in each case, solely to enable BLOOKET's operation of the Service.
If you have any issues with BLOOKET's principles set out in these terms, we will respond to your complaints within thirty (30) days.
If your complaint cannot be resolved through our internal processes, we will direct you to the state or national data protection authority in the jurisdiction where you reside.
If you are in the European Union, you may address privacy-related inquiries to our EU representative pursuant to Article 27 GDPR:

Billing, Payment and BLOOKET Subscription Plans
ALL CHARGES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES AND ALL FUNDS FOR BLOOKET SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART, REGARDLESS OF THE PAYMENT METHOD, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS OR AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW. AT BLOOKET‚ÄôS SOLE DISCRETION, BLOOKET MAY REFUND THE PORTION OF A YEARLY SUBSCRIPTION TO AN INDIVIDUAL IF THEIR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION PURCHASES A PLAN FOR THEIR USE. THE AMOUNT OF THE REFUND SHALL BE CALCULATED BY MULTIPLYING THE AMOUNT OF MONTHS THE TEACHERS USED THE PLAN BY THE MONTHLY FEE FOR USE CALCULATED AT THE MONTHLY AND NOT YEARLY RATE. THAT AMOUNT SHALL BE DEDUCTED FROM THE YEARLY FEE PAID BY THE TEACHER.
BLOOKET Subscription plans
BLOOKET offers both free and paid subscription plans for services offered as Blooket Plus accounts. Blooket Plus Subscription Plans also include Group Plans. Those plans are available in accordance with the following:
BLOOKET Services that may be accessed subject to payment are currently referred to as ‚ÄúBlooket Plus Subscriptions‚Äù. You agree to abide by the terms and restrictions applicable to the Service Plan that you have signed up for.
We reserve the right to change or withdraw features, specifications, services and content of a Service Plan at any time, without notice to you. Please note that the content and features of a Service Plan may vary based on when you signed up and whether you have signed up through our website. We reserve the right to terminate your account for any reason acceptable to BLOOKET.
We will not store or collect your payment card details. That information is provided directly to our third-party payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by their Privacy Policy. These payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of payment information.
The payment processors we work with are:
Stripe

BLOOKET Starter
BLOOKET Starter Services is provided to you free-of-charge, for as long as you use the Services for non-commercial purposes only, in accordance with the limitations of use set out in these Terms. The Service Plan that does not require payment is currently referred to as the ‚ÄúBLOOKET Starter‚Äù. YOU MAY NOT USE BLOOKET STARTER FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES. HENCE, IF YOU INTEND TO USE BLOOKET SERVICES FOR PROFESSIONAL PURPOSES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IN CONJUNCTION WITH OR AS PART OF A PAID SERVICE OR PRODUCT, FOR THE PURPOSE OF MARKETING YOUR OWN OR SOMEONE ELSE‚ÄôS PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR OTHERWISE IN CONJUNCTION WITH A COMMERCIAL EVENT SUCH AS A CONCERT, GAME SHOW OR BROADCASTED EVENT, YOU MUST SIGN UP FOR A PAID SUBSCRIPTION OR ENTER INTO A SEPARATE AGREEMENT WITH BLOOKET.
Paid Subscriptions
BLOOKET PLUS is a paid version of our services. BLOOKET may offer additional subscription offers which are subject to these same terms and conditions. BLOOKET offers various Service Plans for use of the BLOOKET Services at home, in schools, businesses and non-profit organizations. Some Service Plans require payment before you can access them and certain areas of use are only permitted if you have signed up for a Paid Subscription or entered into a separate agreement with BLOOKET. If you have signed up for Paid Subscriptions, you may get access to features that are not available through BLOOKET Starter and you may use the Services for commercial purposes, only if and to the extent such commercial use is permitted under the selected Service Plan.
Pre-paid offers
If you have received a code or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of BLOOKET for access to a Paid Subscription (‚ÄúCode‚Äù), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.
Trials
We may, at our own sole discretion, offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a discounted rate (a ‚ÄúTrial‚Äù). We reserve the right to revoke the Trial and put your account on hold in the event that we determine that you are not eligible.
For some Trials, we‚Äôll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial. We will charge you on a recurring basis for the selected subscription fee at the end of the Trial using the payment details you have provided us, unless you cancel your subscription prior to the end of the Trial.
You have provided your payment details in conjunction with the Trial and you accept that we charge you using such payment details. If you do not want this charge, you must cancel your Paid Subscriptions through your BLOOKET account‚Äôs settings or terminate your BLOOKET account before the end of the Trial. If you do not want to continue to be charged on a recurring monthly or annual basis (as the case may be, depending on your Service Plan), you must cancel the applicable paid subscription through your BLOOKET account‚Äôs subscription page or terminate your BLOOKET account before the end of the recurring monthly period. Paid Subscriptions cannot be terminated before the end of the period for which you have already paid, and except as expressly provided in these terms, BLOOKET will not refund any fees that you have already paid.
Payments, cancellations, upgrades
Payments and cancellations
If you have signed up for BLOOKET Starter or if you cancel your Paid Subscription during a Trial Subscription period, BLOOKET will never charge you any fees for your use of the BLOOKET Service.
If you have signed up for a Paid Subscription for a monthly subscription fee, you will be charged for one month‚Äôs subscription fee. The Paid Subscription and the payment to BLOOKET will automatically renew at the end of the monthly subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription through your subscription page before the end of the current monthly subscription period. The monthly subscription period commences on the day of the month that you purchase the subscription and renews on the same day of the month the following month.
If you have signed up for a Paid Subscription which gives you access to the BLOOKET Service for a specific time period (‚ÄúPre-Paid Period‚Äù), you will be charged for the Pre-Paid Period in advance upon expiration of any Trial. The Paid Subscription and the payment to BLOOKET will automatically renew at the end of the Pre-paid Period unless you cancel your Paid Subscription through your subscription page before the end of the Pre-paid Period.
If you cancel your Paid Subscription, the cancellation will take effect on the day after the last day of the current subscription period, after which you will be downgraded to BLOOKET Starter. We will not refund any subscription fees already paid to us.
BLOOKET may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions from time to time, and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes for Paid Subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. As permitted by local law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the BLOOKET Service after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect, in which case you will be downgraded to BLOOKET Starter.
We do not provide any refunds if the price for a Paid Subscription drops, or if we offer subsequent promotional pricing or change the content or features of a Service Plan. Paid Subscriptions purchased through other platforms are subject to the refund policies of those platforms. BLOOKET cannot be held responsible for these platforms‚Äô policies.
Upgrades and Downgrades
You may at any time upgrade or downgrade your Paid Subscription to a different Service Plan:
Paid Subscriptions ‚Äì Monthly:
If you have downgraded your monthly Paid Subscription to a lower Service Plan, such downgrade will take effect on the day after the last day of the current subscription period.
If you have upgraded your monthly Paid Subscription to a higher Service Plan, such upgrade will take effect immediately subject to payment of the upgrade fee.
Paid Subscriptions ‚Äì Pre-paid Period:
If you have downgraded your Paid Subscription to a lower Service Plan during the Pre-paid Period, such downgrade will take effect on the date of renewal (i.e. the day after the last day of the Pre-paid Period).
If you have upgraded your Paid Subscription to a higher Service Plan during the Pre-paid Period, such upgrade will take effect immediately subject to payment of the upgrade fee and you will automatically enter into a new Pre-paid Period with the same duration as the preceding Pre-paid Period.
Taxes
Prices listed may not include sales or value added tax and applicable tax may be calculated and added at the time you complete a transaction and, depending on where you have purchased your Paid Subscription, such tax may not be visible to you until you receive a receipt for your purchase. In certain jurisdictions, local laws require that prices include all applicable taxes, in which case this will be indicated at the time of the transaction. In the event that you are claiming an exemption from sales tax, you must supply BLOOKET with exemption certificates in order to benefit from any exemption. Failure to supply an exemption certificate will result in the possibility of the charge for sales or value added taxes.

Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability
Nothing in these Terms will prejudice the statutory rights that you may have as a consumer of the Services.

These limitations and exclusions regarding damages apply even if any remedy fails to provide adequate compensation.

Governing Law and Jurisdiction
Any dispute or claim by you arising out of or related to these Terms shall be governed by Delaware law, exclusive of its choice of law rules.

The Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to these Terms.

No Class Actions
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
Most issues can be resolved quickly and amicably by contacting BLOOKET customer support at contact-us@blooket.com. But we understand that sometimes disputes can‚Äôt be easily resolved by customer support. This Section explains how you and BLOOKET agree to resolve those disputes.
Disputes related to these Terms:
If you have an issue related to these Terms, BLOOKET‚Äôs dispute-resolution terms below apply.
Informal Resolution
If you have an issue that our customer support can‚Äôt resolve, prior to starting arbitration you and BLOOKET agree to attempt to resolve the dispute informally to help get us to a resolution and control costs for both parties. You and BLOOKET agree to make a good-faith effort to negotiate any dispute between us for at least 30 days (‚ÄúInformal Resolution‚Äù). Those informal negotiations will start on the day you or BLOOKET receive a written Notice of a Dispute in accordance with these Terms.
You will send your Notice of Dispute to The Law Office of Gregory D. Stewart, P.A., Attn: Gregory D. Stewart, Esq., 409 South Ridge Avenue, Middletown, DE 19709. Include your name, any relevant account name you use, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want BLOOKET to do. If BLOOKET has a dispute with you, BLOOKET will send our Notice of Dispute to your registered email address and any billing address you have provided us.
If you reside in the European Union (‚ÄúEU‚Äù), you may also be entitled to submit your complaint to the European Commission‚Äôs Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) Platform. ODR allows EU consumers to resolve disputes related to the online purchases of goods and services without going to court.
If the dispute isn‚Äôt resolved within by Informal Resolution or small-claims court (below), you or BLOOKET may start an arbitration in accordance with these Terms.
Class Action Waiver
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you and BLOOKET agree to only bring Disputes in an individual capacity and shall not: seek to bring, join, or participate in any class or representative action, collective or class-wide arbitration, or any other action where another individual or entity acts in a representative capacity (e.g., private attorney general actions); or consolidate or combine individual proceedings or permit an arbitrator to do so without the express consent of all parties to these Terms and all other actions or arbitrations.
Severability
If all or any provision of these Terms of Service is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then you and BLOOKET agree that the provision will be severed and the rest of these Terms shall remain in effect and be construed as if any severed provision had not been included. The sole exception is that if the Class Action Waiver is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, you and BLOOKET agree that it will not be severable; any dispute will be resolved in court subject to the venue and choice of clauses specified in these Terms.
Language
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the controlling language for these Terms is English. It is the express wish of the parties that these Terms and all related documents have been drawn up in English. Les parties d√©clarent qu'elles ont demand√© et par les pr√©sentes confirment leur desir expr√©s que cette convention soit r√©digee en anglais. Any translation has been provided for your convenience.
Waiver and Severability
No waiver of these Terms by BLOOKET shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition, and any failure of BLOOKET to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.
If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts will not be arbitrated but will be resolved in court, with the balance resolved through arbitration.
